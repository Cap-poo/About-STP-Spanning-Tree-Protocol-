Before Starting, there are few terms that needs to be defined, and understood.

Redundancy: Network Redundancy is the process of providing multiple path for traffic (backup path) so that data can keep forwarding or flowing evne if the primary path fails. 

here, Redundancy has different meaning depending on the topic that is being discussed, but in terms of networking it is understood as finding multiple path for the packets to flow and keep on operating the business even in the case of event failure.

Layer 2 loop: Layer 2 (data link layer), which consist of switches, and if two or more switches are connected with each other for Redundancy (multiple path), there is high chances that can create a proble called Layer 2 loop.

Let's understand how does the Layer 2 looping occures in case of Redundancy.
